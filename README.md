# tvguide_app
An iOS app for Australian TV Guide written in swift (mid 2015).

This is an iOS app that can be used to access a remote JSON APIs that provide Australian TV listing information.

The API is provided by me and any changes to the underlying interface will be updated in the app available in this repository.

The reason for this app being built was to scratch an itch where there was no readily available iOS device TV Guide for the Australian market.

Data is collected for each state using the xmlTV data grabber, pumped into a PostgreSQL database and made available through the API in a relatively straight forward manner.

Feel free to clone and improve.
